# Vue

A collection of snippets and text related to my learnings of the Vue library

## Overview
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is a declarative framework primarily concerned with creating component-based user interfaces. The creator essentially cherry-picked all of his favourite parts of popular frameworks suchs as React and Angular, and put them into the Vue framework.


## Core

- Vue Instance - the starting point of all Vue applications.
- Templates - the individual UI pieces which make-up the application.
- Components - the individual UI pieces which make-up the application.
  - Props - similar to React, you can pass props to other components via props.
  - Conditional Rendering - 
  - Directives - similar to Angular, directives, e.g. `v-if`, can be used in components.
- Virtual DOM - like React, Vue utilises a virtual DOM; a faster, more reliable abstraction of the native DOM.
- State - it comes with a Redux-like store built-in to the library.
